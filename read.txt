    # To connect your Django project to Git, initialize a git repository in your project folder using the command:
    # git init

    # Then, you can add your files and make your first commit:
    # git add .
    # git commit -m "Initial commit"

    # To connect to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub), use:
    # git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    # git push -u origin master

    # These commands are run in your terminal, not in the Python code.
